# About me
In the Internet I'm known as Nathan Marshall. I'm a student of one Russian state university at the department of information security. 
From early childhood, I already knew how to use a computer. I masterfully held the keyboard and mouse in my hands jumping from directory to directory
exploring the catalogues in Windows XP, watching how my father setting up a LAN connection and something other that I don't really remenber.
You know, after watching a lot movies and series about hackers such as "Who Am I?" or "Mr. Robot" I've become interested in theme of hacking.
Surfing the Web in search of interesting material to study and watching lots of videos from guys from India I learned usage of
Kali Linux pentesting tools, Python, Ruby, C/C++, VB and C# programming languages, discovered a whole world of modern technologies. 
About a year ago, I found out about reverse engineering and malware analysis. Though I'm still in progress mastering all these competencies on a senior level. 
On top of all the above I would like to mention that in my free from university and work time I'm taking some photos and uploading it to my Instagram account.
If you like some of my photos, you can afford them as NFT tokens on OpenSea, so if you want to look, visit the shop page.
